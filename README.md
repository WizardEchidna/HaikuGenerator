# HaikuGenerator

Clone and run. It's one script. You really need me to spell it out for ya?

But seriously, this is a program that generates pseudorandom haikus using the [Datamuse API](https://datamuse.com/api/).

To run, just enter `pep install requirements.txt` to a command line or terminal and then run the script.
