# HaikuGenerator

Clone and run. It's one script. You really need me to spell it out for ya?

But seriously, this is a program that generates pseudorandom haikus using the [Datamuse API](https://datamuse.com/api/).

To run, just enter `pip install requirements.txt` to a command line or terminal and then run the script.

TODO:
Implement basic grammar
Maybe implement weight to random selector to prefer frequent words, improper nouns, etc. without completely rejecting them.
